When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


##### (a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict Sales using Price, Urban, and US.
```{r}
library(ISLR)
attach(Carseats)
fix(Carseats)
lm_sales=lm(Sales~Price+Urban+US)
summary(lm_sales)
```

##### (b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful—some of the variables in the model are qualitative!
##### In this model, the coefficient of sales~price is 13.04, which suggests a postive relationship. 
##### If the store is in an urban location, we will plug-in 1, and the coefficient of sales~Urbanyes is -0.02, which suggests a negative relationship. If the store is not in an urban location, we plug-in 0 to make it inactive in the model.
##### If the store is located in US, we will plug-in 1, and the coefficient of sales~USYes is 1.2, which suggests a postive relationship. If the store is not located in US, we plug-in 0 to make it inactive in the model.


##### (c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.

##### Sales=-0.054*Price-0.022*Urban(No=0, Yes=1)+1.2*US(No=0, Yes=1)


##### (d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis LaTeX: H_{0} : \beta_{j} = 0H 0 : β j = 0?

##### I will reject the null hypothesis for price and USYes.


##### (e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.
```{r}
lm_sales2=lm(Sales~Price+US)
summary(lm_sales2)
```


##### (f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?

##### The adjusted R-squared value of (e) is higher than (a), which means that the (e) model better fits the data.


##### (g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).
```{r}
confint(lm_sales2)
```
##### There is 95% confidence to say that the coefficient of Price is between -0.065 and -0.044 and the coefficient of USYes is between 0.691 and 1.708.


##### (h) Is there evidence of outliers or high leverage observations in the model from (e)?
```{r}
plot(predict(lm_sales2),rstudent(lm_sales2))
plot(hatvalues(lm_sales2))
```

##### From the first plot, we can see that there is no outliers. 
##### From the second plot, we can see that there are several high leverage observations.
